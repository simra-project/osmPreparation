# ARGUMENTS.
#  * region: a string - which region are we currently looking at? Required for writing files.
#  * boundingBox: bounding box for region; used for querying data from Overpass API
#  * bbCentroid: the bounding box centroid (a lat/lon pair); required for map creation
#  * neighbourParam: for the purpose of clustering junctions, we sort them by location.
#                    After sorting, it is obvsly not economical to compare every junction to every 
#                    other junction in the df to determine if they're neighbours. Instead, we're only
#                    looking at the x rows above and below each junction. However, this x will be
#                    different for different regions (as the dfs are of different sizes). Hence,
#                    for every region we're trying out different values for this parameter to compare
#                    the results and determine which value is most suitable.
#  * buffer_size: junctions are buffered into two-dimensional shapes according to the mean width of the
#                highways intersecting at this junction multiplied with a factor. This factor varies 
#                depending on the city layout.
#  * sortingParams: either ['lat','lon'] or ['lon','lat']; that's because we're sorting the junctions
#                   by location to make some operations more efficient and it is more sensible to
#                   sort by lat resp. lon first depending on the shape of the bounding box 
#                   (long but slim bounding box: sort by lat first; wide but low bb: sort by lon first)
