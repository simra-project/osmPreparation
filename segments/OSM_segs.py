# ARGUMENTS.
#  * region: a string - which region are we currently looking at? Required for writing files.
#  * boundingBox: bounding box for region; used for querying data from Overpass API
#  * bbCentroid: the bounding box centroid (a lat/lon pair); required for map creation
#  * neighbourParam: for the purpose of clustering segments, we sort them by location.
#                    After sorting, it is obvsly not economical to compare every segment to every 
#                    other segment in the df to determine if they're neighbours. Instead, we're only
#                    looking at the x rows above and below each segment. However, this x will be
#                    different for different regions (as the dfs are of different sizes). Hence,
#                    for every region we're trying out different values for this parameter to compare
#                    the results and determine which value is most suitable.
#  * buffer_size: segment are buffered into two-dimensional shapes according to the mean width of the
#                highway type. Standards likely differ per country.
#  * sortingParams: either ['minx','maxy'] or ['minx','miny]; that's because we're sorting the segments
#                   by location to make some operations more efficient and it is more sensible to
#                   sort by upper left corner resp. lower left corner first depending on the shape of the 
#                   bounding box 
#                   TODO: does this actually make a difference? Would make sense to test empirically ....
